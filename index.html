                <p>Poster Invasion is a woman-owned social enterprise. 
                    We work with artists all over the world to bring their work to their generation in print form. 
                    We run large-scale turnkey pop-up poster sale events on campuses with 200-35,000+ students. 
                    We are based in Greenville, SC and we operate in 40+ states!
                    The first woman-owned business to successfully make it in the pop-up poster sale space. 
                    We are proudly woman-owned, and use our events to bring diversity, inclusion and representation to 
                    campuses nationwide. Poster Invasion has been certified as a Woman-Owned business by SCMBCC.</p>

                        <h4>All to Pieces</h4>
                        <p>An intricate poster with soft pastels from baby pink to mint green with soft blues and white oil like 
                            background. The main center piece is the renaissance marble statue fragmented into pieces with one hand raised
                            into the air but head turned downward.</p>

                        <p>From the tranquil forest setting with the grand island centered in the middle with a beautifully flowing waterfall
                            descending into the valley below. Accompanying the floating island is the gorgeous red moon in the background to 
                            add a little bit more mystery and wonder to the poster.

                    <h4>Grided Lines</h4>
                        <p>A city landscape based at the bottom of an organized skyline of guided lines coming upward from behind the planed like
                            planets. Each line placed closely together in ways that lead the eye along the horizon with three circles with the 
                            largest one having clouds inside. Faint but there...

                        <h4>Kind Hearted</h4>
                        <p>For kind heart this is a misplaced assumption that it represents a weakness. When in fact being kind is the opposite of
                            weakness. Enjoy a multi colored mix of added modern touch to add to an existing renaissance painting of those who have 
                            fallen from the sky.

                        <h4>Where is My Mind</h4>
                        <p>For a more abstract but gothic look, how about this pitch black background with a skull at the front? Because lets be real, we 
                            all enjoy a little bit of darkness from time to time. It gives us time to think about where we misplace our heads this time!
